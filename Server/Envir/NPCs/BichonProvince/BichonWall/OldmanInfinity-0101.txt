The fee is only '3000 {Gold/Gold}'. What? Too expensive?
You can get 3000 {Gold/Gold} just by collecting and
selling 10 Brown Chestnuts!

#SAY
Ah! What is the Infinite Bout?
In the Infinite Bout, you have to slay all the
monsters that will keep appearing all by themself.
It is a chance to prove your true power and
potential to the very limit.

<What/@info2> should I bear in mind?

[@info2]
#SAY
My advice is simple.
You must rely on your own power only.
And the time limit is two hours
So don't lose your valuable items by being reckless.
Have thorough preparation, OK?

<I will/@info3>

#SAY
I told you everything I can.

Or give it a go?

[@challenge1]
#SAY
Oh, if you fall down during the fight,
You may lose the items you are equipped with.
Are you still willing to go ahead?

<Sure, Bring it on!/@challenge2>
