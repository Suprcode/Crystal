#SAY
{Meat/LightSteelBlue} can be gained from {Hens/Crimson}, {Deer/Crimson}, {Sheep/Crimson}, and {Wolves/Crimson}.
To get meat from any of the above, first of all kill the animal.
Once you have killed it, press the ALT button, while left clicking
on the dead body for a few seconds.
You should then see a piece of meat appear in your inventory.
Using magic to kill an animal burns the meat, reducing its quality to 0.
