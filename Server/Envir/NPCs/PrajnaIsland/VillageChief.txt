 You know. I'm already 90 years old and have lived here
 all my life. If you want to know anything about the 
 island, feel free to ask me at any time. 
 
 <ask/@ask1> about the local legend
 <ask/@ask2> about the monsters
 <ask/@ask3> about the Bottomless Pit

[@ask1]
 According to the legend, 1000 years ago there was an
 epic war, to decide the fate of the world. It happened
 right here on this island... The evil forces from their
 dark, underground lair rose from the earth, using the
 island as a channel to invade the world. 
 <Next/@next1>

[@next1]
 However, mighty heroes appeared, who bravely fought and
 defeated the evil forces after many fierce battles.
 These heroes sealed the path that led to the gateway of
 the evil 
 <Next/@next2>

[@next2]
 Later these heroes built a temple that was based on a maze,
 on top of the sealed path, to block its access; however, as time
 passed, the temple became buried deep into the ground and
 no trace of it can now be found. 
 <Next/@next3>

[@next3]
 What? Unbelievable you say? Ha ha ha...
 of course, that's why I told you it is a legend! 
 <close/@exit>

[@ask2]
 I believe that the monsters spotted recently must be
 the ones mentioned in the legend. Otherwise, how can we
 explain that such things exist in the world?
 I am sure, positive, that they are the ones once defeated
 by the legendary heroes, and are returning once more. 
 <Next/@next4>

[@next4]
 It is the end of the world. The end, I tell you....
 Why must something like this happen in the very twilight
 of my life?
 What misfortune... what sadness... bah!

[@ask3]
 The "Bottomless Pit"? Now there's something I haven't
 heard about in a very long time. It happened such a long
 time ago, so the youngsters here do not know much about
 this. Anyway, it is a true story. 
 <Next/@next5>

[@next5]
 Long ago. there was a pit somewhere in this island.
 whenever strange sound echoed through the pit,
 people passing there nearby
 disappeared all and never returned.
 So it was called "Bottomless Pit. 
 <Next/@next6>

[@next6]
 Ah one man.. there was one man
 who came back alive. He came back covered
 all over with wounds and told us there is
 another world down there full of cruel monsters.
 He spoke some more gibberish
 we couldn't understand him and he died few days later. 
 <Next/@next7>

[@next7]
 The frightened willagers could not bear any more
 and called a famous shaman for an exorcism.
 Maybe because of the exorcism or something
 else, never again we have experienced
 such indidenets of people disappearing. 
 <Next/@next8>

[@next8]
 That's the story and already 70 years have
 passed since then. Now no one remembers
 where was the pit but it might appear again.
 Village elders, who are aware of the incidents,
 aew anxious about that.
