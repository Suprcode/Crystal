I'm dispatched from the Bichon Wall,
preventing the crossed force from Bottomless Pit breaking out..
It may sound simple,but as a matter of fact,very difficult.
The monsters attempt to break the seal endlessly.

What? Do you know what kind of danger you are stepping into?
Even if it is to slay the monsters in BichonWall,
I cannot get involved in such nonsense.
