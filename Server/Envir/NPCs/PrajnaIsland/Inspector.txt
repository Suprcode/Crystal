Hello I'm the inspector dispatched from Bichon.
I sincerely ask you to cooperate with the authorities
if and when something happens around here.
 <Ask/@ask1> what he is investigating
 <Ask/@ask2> about the Bottomless Pit
 <Close/@exit>

[@ask1]
Lately, a number of unidentified monsters have been seen
lurking around here,so I've been sent to find the cause.
according to some rumors, there is a place called the
"Bottomless Pit" on this island. I'm investigating
whether that place has something to do with monsters.

We haven't been able to locate the exact position of this
Bottomless Pit... If you discover it's whereabouts,
please make sure you inform me as soon as you can.
 <Close/@exit>

[@ask2]
I dont actually know in great detail, but from what I heard,
the place is haunted by mysterious forces, and because of that
many villagers have disappeared without trace. People here are
now calling it the "Bottomless Pit", an they have taken to
avoid being out in the wilderness alone.
 <Next/@next2>

[@next2]
I'm afraid that's all the information I have. If you want to
know more about it, go and speak to the village chief
