The worst monster amongst the spider monsters in the woods is a {Rootspider/Crimson}
The {rootspider/Crimson} does not move for itself but it spews larvas continually
The minute a larva sees a human it rushs at them
in order to do a self-destruct
if this {Rootspider/Crimson} is killed, the larves dont appear anymore
But it is a terribly hard battle to kill a {Rootspider/Crimson}.
