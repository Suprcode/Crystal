What do you want to know?

Holy Sword...
It was our very best sword a long time ago. But we don't
have it anymore. People say that the sword is able to
know every kinds of demon and evil for it is holy and reverend.
But a certain villain stole it and ran away with it a long time ago,
so there is nothing left but its legend...
If the HolySword still exists just one place occurs to me...
<Where is it?/@quest1>

There.. Hm.. it is so dangerous that I can not tell you.
I understand your curiosity but if you are killed there,

No information about him remains. I just heard that the former
Rev.taoist of this school thought he was pitiful and permitted
him to stay here. Because he was running away as he had committed
a serious crime before. But he betrayed that trust and stole the
sword, the best sword of this school, and dissapeared.
<Can you tell me What HolySword is?/@next_quest1>

[@next_quest1]
#IF
#SAY
The chronicle or specification for the HolySword vanished since
the sword disappeared from here long time ago. So I don't know
it's detail either. People say it cayses storms to blow dragons to
appear. But thats just hot air. And also an expression of pride and
love for the disappeared best sword of this school.
<Can you tell me where the HolySword is?/@next_quest2>

[@next_quest2]
#IF
#SAY
According to the former Rev.taoist of this school, the person who
stole the HolySword went forward in to the Redmoon Valley across a
Tree path. Then a big group of heroes went there to pursue him but
no one came back. By perfroming magical astrology I found out there
was a very strong demon in Redmoon valley and that it seemed to be
related to the tragedy.
<I see and appreciate your answer/@next_quest3>

[@next_quest3]
#IF
#SAY
A long time ago, the Redmoon valley was a the habitat of the JadeCrystal
Before the demonic power came there. If a certain special power got into
the JadeStick then taoistic defenses will come out of it,  It requires a
JadeCrystal holding. Some special taoistic power to pass there, Only a
taoist of the highest order is able to make a key JadeCrystal. It is 
Possible that the heroes who went into the Redmoon Valley left a sign 
with a JadeCrystal there. Keep this in mind.

I am Perry, the Rev.Taoist of this school. A young hero like you
reminds me of my youth.
Especially of an outstanding thief 'Abel',who's story still makes
my blood boil. You may not be aware of it since you are still
young. Do you want to hear about Abel?
<Hear/@hear> the story
<Skip/@nohear> the story
[@nohear]
Well, everything is gone and useless now.
Get out of here please! 
<Ask/@pre_hear> for the tale again
Just <Get out/@exit>


[@pre_hear]
You want to hear the tale again.
Well if that's what you want. 
<Listen/@next>

[@hear]
You are so curious to find out what
happend before you where born.
Ok I'll tell you what I can remember. 
<Next/@next>


[@next]
It must be approximately 90 years ago now.
When I was only a young fellow in my early twenties.
But my martial art skill was so good as to place me within
the top ten people with Taoist skills.
It is true.  
<Next/@next1>

[@next1]
It was rumored around Bichon Province that a villain stole
the secret know-how and treasures of each prominent Taoist
School, his name was Abel 
<Next/@next2>

[@next2]
As the damage grew, many heroes struggled to arrest
Abel and together decided to catch him in a trap. But
we all made a mistake and underestimated him
we never dreamed that he would have
mastered the best martial art skill of all. 
<Next/@next3>

[@next3]
We organized a new group consisting of high level heroes after
the first group consisted of middle level heroes failed to arrest him.
Finaly we found him in Woomyon Woods. Listen carefully.
<Next/@next4>

[@next4]
Fourteen heroes surrounded him but he was never scared.
What a great man he was!
We tried persuading him to surrender to us
but he didn't answer, consequently a fight began
<Next/@next5>

[@next5]
We could not stop him because not only
was his martial art skill really the best
but also the heroes were not in harmony to attack him.
So, I made a decision to fight man to man.
The heroes stepped back.
A one on one fight between me and him began.
<Next/@next6>

[@next6]
At the end of a fierce fight I was heavily wounded.
but I had injured his leg.
I saw he could not even stand so I relaxed my attention
Then Abel floated in the air as with a kind of
high level martial art and dissapeared
We traced his blood but we failed to find him again
<Next/@next7>

[@next7]
Abel disappeared and the secret know-how was gone with him.
It was rumored that a certain party who wanted the secret
know-how exclusively for themselves hid Abel away.
It caused lot of groups to fight against each other.
Although this fight lasted for ten years no one ever found out
a single clue to his whereabouts.
Finally this fight was over without any satisfactory conclusion.
<Next/@next8>

[@next8]
So far there is no one who has seen Abel since this incident
though it would be a permanent riddle. But there is a rumor
It says a big cave was found out in the Tree path these days,
and the secret know-how.
Abel stole long time ago is hidden there.
<Next/@next9>

[@next9]
But there are many strong monsters there,
and they will try and kill you if you enter.
Now I am too old. For am I not a Rev.Taoist
who is responsible for this Taoist School.
I'll go there and check it out..
