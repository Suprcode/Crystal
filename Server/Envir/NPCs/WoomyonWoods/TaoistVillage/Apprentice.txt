A long time ago, a certain villian stole our {HolySword/LightSteelBlue},
the best sword of our school,
This sword was so holy that there is a legend,
that when it smashes once storm blows and dragons appear
well...who knows it is true or not? But if the sword exists
it's power will is so big we cant even imagine its range.
