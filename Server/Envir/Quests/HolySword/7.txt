[@Description]
Now, let me test you once more
Pass through an ordeal I have prepared and bring me some
EvilApeOil. If you do this, then I'll tell you the way to
get the RedMoonSword

[@TaskDescription]

[@Completion]
What is in the bottle is the foul blood of a RedMoonEvil I killed...
If you disguised yourself as a demon of a man by
smearing it on your clothes and holding an EvilHeart
You can get the RedMoonSword. To kill the RedMoonEvil and
To get rid of the origin of the demon depends upon you.
It is hard for you to kill a RedMoonEvil alone,
Band together with many other heroes..
