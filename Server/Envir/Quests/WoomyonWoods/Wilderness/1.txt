Hello traveller. Thankyou for coming.
The reason I asked for you was to get some
help keeping {WoomyonWoods/Yellow} safe. You 
probably have seen some {CannibalPlant's/Crimson} 
on the way here from {BichonWall/Yellow}. We need 
to hunt them down to keep merchants safe 
from dangerous attacks.

[@TaskDescription]
Please collect 10 {CannibalStem/LightSteelBlue} and 
{CannibalLeafs/LightSteelBlue} From {CannibalPlant's/Crimson} and deliver 
to {MirGuide/LimeGreen} in {BichonWall/Yellow}
