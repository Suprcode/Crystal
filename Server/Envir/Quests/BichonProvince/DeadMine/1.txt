You have been very helpful to many people in 
{Bichon/Yellow}. Do you have any spare time to help me 
as well? A long time ago, I had a friend that I 
went hunting with. We went to {BichonDeadMine/Yellow} 
one day when we where suuounded by 
dangerous creatures. We tried to escape, but 
there where just to many of them. My friend got 
hurt in battle, and he decided to stay behide 
while I escaped to get some help. I wanted 
to get some help but no one was brave enough 
to go help him with me. It's already to late 
but can you go find the remains of my friend? 
He always had his necklace on him.
